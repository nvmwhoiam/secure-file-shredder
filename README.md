# 🔥 Secure File Shredder Pro

_A military-grade secure deletion tool that ensures sensitive files are permanently destroyed beyond any possible recovery_

---

## 📌 Features

```bash
✔️ Military-grade file shredding with multiple overwrite patterns (DoD 5220.22-M compliant)
✔️ Advanced metadata destruction - targets timestamps, filenames and filesystem artifacts
✔️ Configurable security levels (1-7 passes) with intelligent pattern selection
✔️ Smart protected directory detection prevents accidental system file deletion
✔️ Verification layer confirms complete unrecoverability of shredded files
✔️ Drag & drop interface with batch processing capabilities
✔️ Detailed audit logging with timestamped operation records
✔️ Cross-platform support (Windows 10/11, macOS 10.15+, Linux)
✔️ Lightweight (no admin rights required) with minimal system impact
✔️ Progress tracking with time remaining estimates for large files
```

## 🛡️ Security Implementation Details

```text
🔐 Overwrite Patterns:
   • Pass 1: Null bytes (0x00)
   • Pass 2: Ones (0xFF)
   • Pass 3: Random data (cryptographically secure)
   • Pass 4: Alternating bits (0xAA)
   • Pass 5: Inverse alternating (0x55)
   • Pass 6: Custom pattern (0xDEADBEEF)
   • Pass 7: Final random pass

🔐 Metadata Removal:
   • File timestamps randomized
   • Original filename obliterated
   • NTFS/MFT artifacts targeted (Windows)
   • Journaling artifacts removed (macOS/Linux)

🔐 Protection Features:
   • Blocks shredding of system directories
   • Prevents recursive folder deletion
   • Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
```

## 📊 Performance Metrics

```text
Benchmarks (on 1GB file with SSD):
• 1 Pass: ~15 seconds
• 3 Passes: ~45 seconds
• 7 Passes: ~105 seconds

System Impact:
• CPU Usage: 15-25% during operation
• RAM Usage: <50MB typically
• Disk I/O: Optimized sequential writes
```

THIS IS NOT A RECYCLE BIN TOOL!
Files processed with Secure File Shredder Pro are:
• Irreversibly destroyed
• Unrecoverable by any software
• Gone permanently from physical storage

Use with extreme caution - there is NO undo functionality.
For maximum security, consider physical destruction of storage media
for truly sensitive data as an additional measure.
